## FAQ

### A word about iCloud-Sync
Since this is an open-source project and should be runnable without further configuration or an Apple Developer Subscription after cloning it, I've not planned to implement iCloud synchronization any time soon.

Feel free to discours with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LaurensKDev).

### macOS Catalyst-App
As I mentioned, Playzlib will not get iCloud synchronization any time soon and therefore, a macOS-Version of Playzlib would make no sense because you can't synchronize your Playz across your Apple devices.
