## FAQ

### A word about iCloud-Sync
Since this is an open-source project and should be runnable without further configuration or an Apple Developer Subscription after cloning it, I've not planned to implement iCloud synchronization any time soon.

Feel free to discuss with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LaurensKDev).

### macOS Catalyst-App
As I mentioned, Playzlib will not get iCloud synchronization any time soon and therefore, a macOS-Version of Playzlib wouldn't be nice to use. Regardless of this small UX issue, I'll work on a macOS version of Playzlib when the first iOS build is released.
