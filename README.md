Playzlib is the one-and-only soundboard app you need. It's easy to add, manage and share sounds and offers a completely ad-free experience.

The goal of Playzlib is to provide their users with a fully ads-free and transparent way to manage, play and share small audio files. In fact, we're not even using a single tracking or ad-provider for Playzlib and developed an open sharing system to allow users to export and share all sounds stored in the library.

Adding a so-called "Playz" is very easy. Just get an audio or video file and import it to Playzlib and you're good to go.

Playzlib is designed to let you add sounds from everywhere. Even streaming apps like YouTube or Vimeo are supported and the process of adding sounds to Playzlib is very easy and straight forward. 

Click the "Add Sounds" button in Playzlib to get a more detailed description of how to add sounds to Playzlib.

Since we're trying to offer our users full transparency over how data is stored and managed in the app, Playzlib is fully open-source and interested people can easily view every line of code on GitHub - just search for "Playzlib-App".

## FAQ

### A word about iCloud-Sync
Since this is an open-source project and should be runnable without further configuration or an Apple Developer Subscription after cloning it, I've not planned to implement iCloud synchronization any time soon.

Feel free to discuss with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laurensk).

### macOS Catalyst-App
As I mentioned, Playzlib will not get iCloud synchronization any time soon and therefore, a macOS-Version of Playzlib wouldn't be nice to use. Regardless of this small UX issue, I'll work on a macOS version of Playzlib when the first iOS build is released.
